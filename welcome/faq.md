<summary>What is the difference between rolling funds and a syndication?</summary>

A rolling fund and a syndication are both types of investment vehicles that allow investors to pool their money together for investment purposes, but they differ in some key ways.

A rolling fund is a type of investment fund that allows investors to make smaller, recurring investments on a quarterly basis, rather than committing a large sum of money upfront.&#x20;

Rolling funds offer greater accessibility to investors and consistent cash flow for fund managers. They are typically structured as a limited partnership and allow ongoing investments with a broader investment focus.

A syndicate is a group of investors who pool their money together to invest in a specific project or venture. Syndicates are usually formed for a single investment opportunity and are structured as special-purpose vehicles (SVPs). They generally require a larger minimum investment.

In the case of EarlyVentures our Fund investment type represents a rolling fund whereas a start-up investment type represents a syndicate.&#x20;
