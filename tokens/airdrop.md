## How to Earn Points

Your journey to earning more tokens begins with accumulating points. Below are the methods through which you can enhance your points balance:



Points are earned daily based on the assets you hold and the referrals you make. The more assets you have, and the more successful referrals you make, the higher your points tally will be.

### Base Points from Assets

For every dollar ($1) of assets you have in your account, you earn 1 point per day.

**Example:** If you have $1000 in assets, you will earn 1000 points every day.



### Points Multiplier from Referrals

Each referral you make boosts your points multiplier by +0.1. This multiplier is applied to the points you earn from your assets.

**Example:** If you referred 5 people, your multiplier would be 1.5 (1 + 0.1\*5).



### Bonus Points from Referrals' Earnings

In addition to the multiplier, you also earn a bonus of 16% of the points that each of your referrals earns every day. By referring friends and family, you not only increase your points through direct referrals but also through the activities of their referrals, up to two levels deep.

#### **Direct Referrals:**

* **Multiplier Effect:** Each referral enhances your multiplier, increasing the points you earn from your assets.
* **Bonus from Referral’s Earnings:** Enjoy a 16% bonus on top of the points your direct referrals earn.

#### **Second-Level Referrals:**

* **Extended Network Bonus:** Earn an 8% bonus on the points earned by your direct referral’s invites. The more they invest, the more points you earn.

**Example:** If your referral earns 1000 points in a day, you receive a bonus of 100 points.

## Calculating Your Points

Here's how your daily points are calculated:

1. **Base Points:** Determine the points from your assets.
   * Formula: `Base Points = Assets ($)`
2. **Multiplier:** Apply your multiplier based on the number of referrals.
   * Formula: `Total Points from Assets = Base Points * Multiplier`
3. **Referral Bonus:** Add the bonus points from your referrals' earnings.
   * Formula: `Total Points for the Day = Total Points from Assets + Referral Bonus Points`

## Example Scenario

Let's go through an example:

* **Alice** has $1000 in assets and has referred **Bob**, who has $500 in assets.
* **Alice's** multiplier is 1.1 (for one referral).
* **Bob** earns 500 points from his assets (no multiplier as he has no referrals).

Calculating **Alice's** points:

1. Base Points = 1000 (from her $1000 in assets).
2. Total Points from Assets = 1000 \* 1.1 = 1100 (applying her multiplier).
3. Referral Bonus = 10% of Bob's 500 points = 50.

**Alice's Total Points for the Day = 1150.**
