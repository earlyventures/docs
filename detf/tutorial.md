# Create your ETF

## Step 1: Basic Information

### 1. ETF Name 

Choose a unique name that tells people what your fund is about.

• Example: If your fund invests in meme tokens, you might call it “New Meme Token.”

### 2. Token Name

Pick a short and memorable name for your token, usually 3-5 letters.

• Example: For “New Meme Token,” you could use “NMT.”

### 3. ETF/Token Picture

Provide a link to a picture that represents your fund.

• Example: Use an image URL like “https://free.cdn/my-best-fund-logo.png.”

### 4. Describe Your Fund

Write a short description about what your fund does and its goals.

• Example: “This fund buys meme tokens I’m most bullish on for July 2024.”

## Step 2: Portfolio Setup

Setting Up Tokens and Their Weights: You need to pick at least 3 and up to 100 different tokens (cryptocurrencies) for your fund. The total percentage of all tokens should add up to 100%.

&#x20;Example: If you choose 5 tokens, you might assign weights like this: Token A (20%), Token B (20%), Token C (20%), Token D (20%), Token E (20%).\


### Adding Tokens

• Token Symbol:   Enter the short name or symbol of the token.

Example: If you’re adding Sui, the symbol is “SUI.”

• Weight: Enter the percentage of your fund that this token will represent.

Example: If SUI is 20% of your fund, you enter “20%.”

Repeat: Continue adding tokens until the total weight equals 100%.

Once you’ve added all tokens and their weights correctly, you will see a success message.

## Step 3: Fee Setup

As the fund owner, you can decide how you will earn money by choosing between four types of commissions:

### &#x20;Types of fees

#### 1. Deposit Fee:

&#x20;A small charge when someone adds money to your fund.

• _Example:_ If the deposit fee is $1, every time someone puts money in your fund, you will earn $1.

#### 2. Withdraw Fee:&#x20;

A small charge when someone takes money out of your fund.

• _Example:_ If the withdraw fee is $1, every time someone withdraws money from your fund, you will earn $1.

#### 3. Management Fee:

A yearly fee, a small percentage of the total money in your fund. The recommended range is 1% to 3%. This rate is calculated per year, but you will earn the profit daily, which means the yearly rate divided by 365.

• Example: If your fund has $1,000 and the management fee is 2%, you will earn $20 per year, approximately $0.05 per day.

#### 4. Performance Fee:

A fee based on the fund’s profit, charged when the fund makes money. The recommended range is 5% to 25%.

• Example: If your fund grows from $1,000 to $1,200, and the performance fee is 20%, you will earn $40 (20% of the $200 profit). If the fund value goes down, you don’t earn this fee.
