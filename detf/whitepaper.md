The Custom DETF empowers users to design their own ETFs with up to 100 different tokens, providing a seamless and efficient way to manage and share investment strategies. This feature is ideal for crypto enthusiasts, influencers, community leaders, and investors looking to diversify their portfolios with a decentralized and transparent solution.

3. **Monetization:**

## How It Works

* **Management Fee:** A percentage of the TLV (Total Locked Value) set per year. The standard amount is 2%.

High-Water Mark Explained



The high-water mark is a performance fee calculation method used to ensure fairness to investors and to fund managers. Here’s how it works:



• Initial Value: When an investor first puts money into the fund, that amount is recorded as the initial high-water mark.

• Performance Calculation: The performance fee is only charged on the new profits that exceed the previous high-water mark.

• Resetting the Mark: If the fund’s value decreases, no performance fee is charged until the fund’s value surpasses the previous high-water mark.\


Example:



• Year 1: An investor puts $10,000 into a fund. By the end of the year, the fund grows to $12,000. The high-water mark is now $12,000, and the performance fee is charged on the $2,000 profit.

• Year 2: The fund drops to $11,000. No performance fee is charged.

• Year 3: The fund grows to $13,000. The high-water mark is surpassed, so the performance fee is charged on the $1,000 profit above the previous $12,000 mark.

This method ensures that investors only pay performance fees on actual profits beyond their highest investment value, promoting trust and fairness.
