## **How often do I earn?**

You can decide the schedule to withdraw money from the fund daily, weekly, or monthly. We recommend monthly.

## **How can I rebalance?**

Rebalancing means adjusting the weights of tokens in your portfolio to maintain the desired allocation.

&#x20;**Example:** If Token A has grown too much, you might reduce its weight from 30% to 20% and increase another tokenâ€™s weight to keep the balance. For instance, if Token B was initially 10%, you can increase it to 20% to match your strategy.

## **Can I change the fund portfolio?**

Yes, you can modify the tokens in your fund based on new strategies or insights.

&#x20;**Example:** If you change your mind about a token and want to remove it from the fund, you can update your strategy. Or, if you find a new token you want to add, you can include it.

## **How do i earn?**

As the fund manager, you can decide how you will earn. You can choose to not take any fees or use a combination of these options:

1\. Deposit Fee: 1. If a user deposits $100 using a token, you will earn a fix fee.

2\. Withdraw Fee: A fixed amount in USD for withdrawing funds. If the withdraw fee is $1, every time someone takes money out, you will earn $1.

3\. Management Fee:  If your fund has $1,000 and the management fee is 2%, you will earn about $0.05 per day.

4\. Performance Fee:  If your fund grows from $1,000 to $1,200, and the performance fee is 20%, you will earn $40.
