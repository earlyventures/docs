# Security

At EarlyVentures, the safety and autonomy of your investments are our top priorities. As a decentralized finance (DeFi) product, we operate on a non-custodial basis. This means we do not hold custody of your funds or walletâ€”empowering you with full control over your assets.

## Non-Custodial Platform

* **Full Control to You:** By design, being non-custodial means you have complete control over your funds and wallet. EarlyVentures does not store or have access to your assets

**Account Recovery:** It's important to note that if access to your account is lost, EarlyVentures cannot recover your funds due to our non-custodial nature.
{% endhint %}

## Secure Wallet Creation with Web3Auth

* **Seamless Sign-Up:** For users signing up via social media or email, we integrate a secure third-party service, Web3Auth, to generate a wallet linked to your account. This approach ensures a blend of convenience and security.
* **Wallet Portability:** You have the flexibility to export and re-import your wallet into your preferred wallet application, maintaining control over your digital assets.

## Exporting Your Wallet

To maintain access to your funds across platforms, follow these steps to export your private key:

1. **Go to Account Settings:** Access the Security tab within your account settings.
2. **Export Private Key:** From here, you can securely export your wallet's private key.
3. **Import to Preferred Wallet:** Use the exported key to import your wallet into applications like Metamask, Trust Wallet, etc.

EarlyVentures cannot access your private key. It is accessible exclusively through your account.
