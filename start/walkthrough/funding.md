## Large Orders

* **Using Major Exchanges:** For larger transactions, we recommend using a major exchange (e.g., Binance, OKX, Kraken) or your local exchange. These platforms offer deposit methods tailored to your country, usually with no fees, and accept wire transfers as well.
* **Future Wire Transfer Options:** We are in the process of partnering to accept wire transfers directly, aiming to make this option available soon for even greater convenience.
