# Whitepaper

In our DeFi platform, the investment ecosystem is built around four core smart contracts that interoperate to provide a robust and secure framework for managing digital assets. These contracts include:

1. **Fund Contract**: Central to the platform, this contract handles the primary operations of asset management, including deposits, withdrawals, and fee collection. It operates with an array of tokens and integrates strategic allocation methods to balance the portfolio according to predefined criteria.
2. **Fund Token Contract**: This contract issues and manages tokens that represent shares in the fund. These tokens are held by investors as proof of their participation and claim on the fund's assets. The token mechanics ensure that shares are minted upon deposits and burned during withdrawals, directly linking the fundâ€™s equity to the circulating token supply.
3. **Controller Contract**: Serving as the administrative backbone, this contract provides the necessary controls and permissions for the operation of the fund. It facilitates the implementation of management strategies, enforcement of fees, and other administrative tasks essential to the fund's operation.
4. **Synthetic Token Contract**: This contract manages the creation and operation of synthetic assets. These tokens are derivatives that represent other real or virtual assets and are used within the fund to achieve broader exposure and hedging capabilities without holding the underlying assets directly.

Together, these contracts form a comprehensive system designed to offer a transparent, efficient, and secure investment platform, leveraging blockchain technology to democratize access to asset management services.
