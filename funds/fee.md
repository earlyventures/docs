# Fee

EarlyVentures do not have custody of your funds or wallet. We are a DEFI product. It's non-custodian.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
This also mean that if you lose access to your account we cannot recover your funds.
{% endhint %}

If you signup using your social or email, we use a secure third party service called web3auth to generat a wallet for you linked to that account. You can export and reimport that wallet in your favorite wallet.&#x20;

#### Export Your Wallet

Navigate to the Security tab in Account Settings to export your wallet private key and import it in your wallet, such as Metamask, Trust Wallet etc..

{% hint style="success" %}
Earlyventures do not have access to your private key. The key is only visible from your account.
