# Fee

## Fee Structure

Our commitment to aligning our success with yours is reflected in our fee structure, which is deliberately designed to be both fair and competitive within the industry. We charge a 1% management fee per year on the assets under management. Additionally, a performance fee averaging 10% is applied, but with a key consideration to ensure that our interests are closely aligned with those of our clients: the application of a high-water mark.



## Management Fee

The management fee is a fixed charge of 0.5% to 2% per year on the assets we manage on your behalf. This fee is in line with industry standards and covers the operational costs of managing your investments, including but not limited to, research, trading, compliance, and customer service.



## Performance Fee

Our performance fee is calculated based on the profits generated by your investments, adhering to a high-water mark (HWM) policy to ensure fairness and alignment of interests. The fee averages around 10% but can vary depending on the specific fund strategy:

* **Crypto100 Fund:** A lower performance fee of 10%, reflecting the fund's broad market strategy.
* **Bull Fund:** A higher performance fee of up to 20%, justified by the intensive effort our team invests in identifying high-potential tokens, requiring more research and a proactive management approach.

Refer to each fund's page to see which performance fee is applied.

### High-Water Mark (HWM) Explained

The high-water mark ensures performance fees are charged only on new profits, above the highest value your account has previously reached.

**Example scenario:**

* Initial Investment Value: $100,000
* Growth to New High: $150,000
  * Performance fee applied on the profit ($50,000 x 10%=$5000).
* Subsequent Decline: Down to $130,000 (No performance fee since itâ€™s below the HWM).
* Recovery to: $150,000
  * No performance fee is charged on recovery up to $150,000 because it hasn't surpassed the HWM.

## Fee deduction process

Both the management fee and the performance fee are automatically deducted on a daily basis directly from the fund's cash balance. This method ensures transparency and efficiency in the fee deduction process, aligning with our commitment to straightforward and fair financial practices.
