**Fund Shares as Tradable Tokens**: In this case, the fund shares are represented as tokens, with each token having a market value. The value of these tokens fluctuates based on the underlying assets' performance in the fund. When you invest in such a fund, you are essentially buying a share of the underlying assets. The tradability of these tokens means that investors can buy or sell them in the open market, and the price of the tokens reflects the current valuation of the fund's portfolio.
