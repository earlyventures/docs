# Vault

**Yield Vaults**: Yield vaults, on the other hand, are focused on generating yield from the assets deposited by investors. The value of your deposit in a yield vault doesn't fluctuate in the same way as a tradable token. Instead, the return comes from the yield generated by the strategies employed by the vault. Here, you are not buying a share of the underlying assets but are rather investing in a strategy to earn returns (yield) on those assets.
