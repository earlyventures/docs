# Fund vs Vault

* **Yield Vault**: It's like putting your assets in a smart, automated system that hope around different DeFi platforms to earn you the best possible yield.
* **Crypto Fund**: Think of it as investing in a basket of various cryptocurrencies, managed by experts who decide the best mix to maximize returns. The value of your investment changes with the market.

* **Fund Shares as Tradable Tokens**: In this case, the fund shares are represented as tokens, with each token having a market value. The value of these tokens fluctuates based on the underlying assets' performance in the fund. When you invest in such a fund, you are essentially buying a share of the underlying assets. The tradability of these tokens means that investors can buy or sell them in the open market, and the price of the tokens reflects the current valuation of the fund's portfolio.
* **Yield Vaults**: Yield vaults, on the other hand, are focused on generating yield from the assets deposited by investors. The value of your deposit in a yield vault doesn't fluctuate in the same way as a tradable token. Instead, the return comes from the yield generated by the strategies employed by the vault. Here, you are not buying a share of the underlying assets but are rather investing in a strategy to earn returns (yield) on those assets.
