### What are options? <a href="#mntl-sc-block_2-0-7" id="mntl-sc-block_2-0-7"></a>

Options are contracts that give the bearer the right—but not the obligation—to either buy or sell an amount of some underlying asset at a predetermined price at or before the contract expires.Options are powerful because they can enhance an individual’s portfolio. They do this through added income, protection, and even leverage. Depending on the situation, there is usually an option scenario appropriate for an investor’s goal. A popular example would be using options as an effective [hedge](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedge.asp) against a declining stock market to limit downside losses.Options can also generate recurring income. Additionally, they are often used for speculative purposes, such as wagering on the direction of a stock.

#### How do options work? <a href="#mntl-sc-block_2-0-68" id="mntl-sc-block_2-0-68"></a>

In terms of valuing option contracts, it is essentially all about determining the probabilities of future price events. The more likely something is to occur, the more expensive an option that profits from that event would be. For instance, a call value goes up as the stock (underlying) goes up. This is the key to understanding the relative value of options.The less time there is until expiry, the less value an option will have. This is because the chances of a price move in the underlying stock diminish as we draw closer to expiry. This is why an option is a wasting asset. If you buy a one-month option that is out of the money, and the stock doesn’t move, the option becomes less valuable with each passing day. Because time is a component of the price of an option, a one-month option is going to be less valuable than a three-month option. This is because with more time available, the probability of a price move in your favor increases, and vice versa.Accordingly, the same option strike that expires in a year will cost more than the same strike for one month. This wasting feature of options is a result of [time decay](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timedecay.asp). The same option will be worth less tomorrow than it is today if the price of the stock doesn’t move.Volatility also increases the price of an option. This is because uncertainty pushes the odds of an outcome higher. If the volatility of the underlying asset increases, larger price swings increase the possibilities of substantial moves both up and down. Greater price swings will increase the chances of an event occurring. Therefore, the greater the volatility, the greater the price of the option. Options trading and volatility are intrinsically linked to each other in this way.On most U.S. exchanges, a stock option contract is the option to buy or sell 100 shares; that's why you must multiply the contract premium by 100 to get the total amount you’ll have to spend to buy the call.

| What happened to our option investment |       |        |             |
| -------------------------------------- | ----- | ------ | ----------- |
|                                        | May 1 | May 21 | Expiry Date |
| Stock Price                            | $67   | $78    | $62         |
| Option Price                           | $3.15 | $8.25  | worthless   |
| Contract Value                         | $315  | $825   | $0          |
| Paper Gain/Loss                        | $0    | $510   | -$315       |

The majority of the time, holders choose to take their profits by trading out (closing out) their position. This means that option holders sell their options in the market, and writers buy their positions back to close. Only about 10% of options are exercised, 60% are traded (closed) out, and 30% expire worthlessly.Fluctuations in option prices can be explained by [intrinsic value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp) and [extrinsic value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/extrinsicvalue.asp), which is also known as time value. An option's premium is the combination of its intrinsic value and time value. Intrinsic value is the in-the-money amount of an options contract, which, for a call option, is the amount above the strike price that the stock is trading. Time value represents the added value an investor has to pay for an option above the intrinsic value. This is the extrinsic value or time value. So the price of the option in our example can be thought of as the following:

| Premium = | Intrinsic Value + | Time Value |
| --------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| $8.25     | $8.00             | $0.25      |

In real life, options almost always trade at some level above their intrinsic value, because the probability of an event occurring is never absolutely zero, even if it is highly unlikely.(Source: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/options-basics-tutorial-4583012#toc-what-are-options))
